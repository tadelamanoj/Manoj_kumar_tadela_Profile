        "descr":"At QI-CAP, a leading High-Frequency Trading platform, I spearheaded the development of pivotal features, notably the Strategy Builder and Pay-off Charts, from inception to implementation. These enhancements empower traders to craft bespoke strategies, offering predictive insights into potential gains or losses. Leveraging the robust Chart.js visualization library, I ensured seamless generation of dynamic graphs. Beyond this, I championed a solo effort in architecting and building the Employee-Company Portal, a comprehensive system conceived from the ground up. This encompassing solution boasts a myriad of functionalities, which I'm eager to elaborate on during interviews.",
